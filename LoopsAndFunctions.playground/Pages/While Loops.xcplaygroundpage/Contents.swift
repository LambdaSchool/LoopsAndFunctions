 ## While Loops
 
 Create a while loop that simulates rolling a 6-sided dice repeatedly until a 1 is rolled. After each roll, print the value. (Hint: use `Int.random(in: 1...6)` to generate a random number between 1 and 6). Int.random is a function that takes in a Range. You can easily create a Range by putting `...` between two numbers like in the example above.
